# dogs_cnn
A convolutional neural network to classify images of dogs based on breed - using the Stanford Dogs dataset.

The final model displayed ~0.83 accuracy on the training data and ~0.85 accuracy on the validation set after tuning the hyperparameters and introducing a learning rate reduction. The model was an EfficientNetB0 model with 13 layers added.
